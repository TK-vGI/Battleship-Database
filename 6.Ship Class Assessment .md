# Stage 6/6: Ship Class Assessment
## Description
Now that we've found some relevant information, let's do some analysis. Specifically, let's identify the ship classes  
that were actively involved in no less than three battles, during the Second World War.  
Then, for each ship class, count the number of damaged ships, sunk ships, and OK ships belonging to that class.

## Objectives
- Identify the ship `class` that had participated in at least three battles using the `Classes` table.  
- Then, retrieve the number of damaged ships (`num_damaged`), sunk ships (`num_sunk`), and operational ships (`num_ok`)  
  for each identified class from the `Outputs` table.  
- Maintain the specified column order.  
- Use the `GROUP BY` clause and `JOIN` to solve the problem.

Take a look at the following database structure:

## Explanation of the database:  

The `**Classes**` table represents different categories of ships that participated in the World War II.  
    It stores information about each: **ship class**, including:
- `class`: the class name. It is the `primary key`.  
- `type`:type of ship represented as: battleship (`'bb'`) or battlecruiser (`'bc'`),  
- `country`: the country where the ship was built  
- `numGuns`: the number of main guns  
- `bore`: the gun caliber represented by the bore diameter in inches,  
- `displacement`: and the displacement (displacement) measured in weight tons.

The `**Ships**` table contains details about each ship, including:  
- `name`: the name of the ship. It is the `primary key`. 
- `class`: the class to which it belongs. It is the `foreign key` to category of ships defined in the Classes table.
- `launched`: and the year it was launched into the water.

The `**Battles**` table stores information about the various battles in which the ships participated during the World War II.  
    It includes:  
- `name`: the name of the battle. It is the `primary key`.
- `date`: the date on which the battle took place.

The `**Outcomes**` table provides data on the results of the ship's participation in each battle. It includes:  
- `name`: the name of the ship that took part in the battle  
- `batlle`: the name of the battle in which the ship participated  
- `result`: the result of the ship's involvement:
  - categorized as "sunk" if the ship was sunk during the battle,  
  - "damaged" if the ship was damaged during the battle,  
  - "OK" if the ship remained undamaged after the battle.

Table names are case-sensitive.

## Example

_Outcomes Table Example:_

| ship         | battle               | result  |
|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| Yamagumo     | Battle of Okinawa    | OK      |
| Yamashiro II | Pearl Harbor         | sunk    |
| USS Caroline | Battle of Leyte Gulf | damaged |
| Bismarck     | Pearl Harbor         | sunk    |
| Ise          | Battle of Leyte Gulf | sunk    |

_Ships Table Example:_

| name         | class        | launched |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Yamagumo     | Yamashiro II | 1922     |
| Yamashiro II | Yamashiro II | 1916     |
| USS Caroline | Hood         | 1931     |
| Bismarck     | Bismarck II  | 1939     |
| Yamato       | Yamashiro II | 1928     |

Based on the data presented in the tables above, it is evident that the ships `Yamagumo`, `Yamashiro II` and `Yamato` had  
participated in battles during the World War II, as recorded in the `Outcomes` table. All three ships belonged to  
the `Yamashiro II` class, according to the `Ships` table. Among them, the ship `Yamagumo` remained operational,  
while the ships `Yamashiro II` and `Yamato` were sunk.

Thus, after identifying the ship classes that had participated in at least three battles and analyzing their outcomes,  
the final output is:

| class        | num_damaged | num_sunk | num_ok |
|--------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Yamashiro II | 0           | 2        | 1      |

_From the output above, it can be seen that the order of the columns is  `class`-> `num_damaged`->`num_sunk`->`num_ok`_

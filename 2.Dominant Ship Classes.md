# Stage 2/6: Dominant Ship Classes
## Description
Your next goal is to identify the ships that had the most powerful weapons based on the number of guns.  
Specifically, your goal is to identify the predominant ship classes to determine which ship manufacturer (class)  
had excelled at creating ships equipped with heavy artillery.

## Objectives
- Identify the `class` and `numGuns` details of the `ship` classes having maximum `numGuns` from the `Classes` table of the **battleship database**.  
- Use the `MAX` aggregate function to solve the problem.  
- The column order is essential.  

Take a look at the following database structure:

## Explanation of the database:  

The `**Classes**` table represents different categories of ships that participated in the World War II.  
    It stores information about each: **ship class**, including:
- `class`: the class name. It is the `primary key`.  
- `type`:type of ship represented as: battleship (`'bb'`) or battlecruiser (`'bc'`),  
- `country`: the country where the ship was built  
- `numGuns`: the number of main guns  
- `bore`: the gun caliber represented by the bore diameter in inches,  
- `displacement`: and the displacement (displacement) measured in weight tons.

The `**Ships**` table contains details about each ship, including:  
- `name`: the name of the ship. It is the `primary key`. 
- `class`: the class to which it belongs. It is the `foreign key` to category of ships defined in the Classes table.
- `launched`: and the year it was launched into the water.

The `**Battles**` table stores information about the various battles in which the ships participated during the World War II.  
    It includes:  
- `name`: the name of the battle. It is the `primary key`.
- `date`: the date on which the battle took place.

The `**Outcomes**` table provides data on the results of the ship's participation in each battle. It includes:  
- `name`: the name of the ship that took part in the battle  
- `batlle`: the name of the battle in which the ship participated  
- `result`: the result of the ship's involvement:
  - categorized as "sunk" if the ship was sunk during the battle,  
  - "damaged" if the ship was damaged during the battle,  
  - "OK" if the ship remained undamaged after the battle.

Table names are case-sensitive.

## Example

_Classes Table Example:_

| class    | type | country | numGuns | bore | displacement |
|----------|------|---------|---------|------|--------------|
| Yamagumo | bb   | Japan   | 10      | 15   | 50000        |
| Nagato   | bc   | Japan   | 12      | 16   | 50000        |
| Hood     | bb   | US      | 10      | 14   | 43000        |
| Bismarck | bb   | Germany | 8       | 14   | 40000        |
| Ise      | bc   | Japan   | 12      | 16   | 45000        |

From the data presented in the table above, it is evident that classes `Nagato` and `Ise` have the highest `numGuns`.  
The output of the table after identifying **Classes** with the highest `numGuns`:

| class  | numGuns |
|--------|---------|
| Ise    | 12      |
| Nagato | 12      |


_From the output above, it can be seen that the order of the columns is `class`-> `numGuns`_

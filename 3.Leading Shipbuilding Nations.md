# Stage 3/6: Leading Shipbuilding Nations
## Description
After identifying the most powerful classes of ships, your focus has shifted to determining the most dominant countries. Your specific interest lies in identifying the country that had produced the greatest number of battleship classes.

## Objectives
- Identify the `country` and the corresponding number of battleship (` 'bb' `) classes produced by that country as `num_battleships`  
  from the `Classes` table of the **battleship database**.  
- Ensure to retrieve only one `country` that had produced the maximum number of battleship classes.  
- Use the `GROUP BY` clause to solve the problem.
- The column order is essential.  

Take a look at the following database structure:

![Explanation of the database](./IMG1.png)

## Explanation of the database:  

The `**Classes**` table represents different categories of ships that participated in the World War II.  
    It stores information about each: **ship class**, including:
- `class`: the class name. It is the `primary key`.  
- `type`:type of ship represented as: battleship (`'bb'`) or battlecruiser (`'bc'`),  
- `country`: the country where the ship was built  
- `numGuns`: the number of main guns  
- `bore`: the gun caliber represented by the bore diameter in inches,  
- `displacement`: and the displacement (displacement) measured in weight tons.

The `**Ships**` table contains details about each ship, including:  
- `name`: the name of the ship. It is the `primary key`. 
- `class`: the class to which it belongs. It is the `foreign key` to category of ships defined in the Classes table.
- `launched`: and the year it was launched into the water.

The `**Battles**` table stores information about the various battles in which the ships participated during the World War II.  
    It includes:  
- `name`: the name of the battle. It is the `primary key`.
- `date`: the date on which the battle took place.

The `**Outcomes**` table provides data on the results of the ship's participation in each battle. It includes:  
- `name`: the name of the ship that took part in the battle  
- `batlle`: the name of the battle in which the ship participated  
- `result`: the result of the ship's involvement:
  - categorized as "sunk" if the ship was sunk during the battle,  
  - "damaged" if the ship was damaged during the battle,  
  - "OK" if the ship remained undamaged after the battle.

Table names are case-sensitive.

## Example

_Classes Table Example:_

| class    | type | country | numGuns | bore | displacement |
|----------|------|---------|---------|------|--------------|
| Yamagumo | bb   | Japan   | 10      | 15   | 50000        |
| Nagato   | bc   | Japan   | 12      | 16   | 50000        |
| Hood     | bb   | US      | 10      | 14   | 43000        |
| Bismarck | bb   | Germany | 8       | 14   | 40000        |
| Ise      | bc   | Japan   | 12      | 16   | 45000        |

From the data presented in the table above, it is evident that `Japan` produced the highest number of battleship (`'bb'`) classes.  
The output of the table after identifying the `country` producing the highest number of battleship(`num_battleships`) classes:

| country | num_battleships |
|---------|-----------------|
| Japan   | 2               |


_From the output above, it can be seen that the order of the columns is `country`-> `num_battleships`_

## Query template:
```markdown
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as num_battleships ...;

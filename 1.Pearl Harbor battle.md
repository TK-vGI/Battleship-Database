# Stage 1/6: "Pearl Harbor" battle
## Description
As a new fleet admiral exploring the naval battles of the Second World War, you're curious about the significant  
events during that time. You're especially interested in understanding the details of the Pearl Harbor attacks in 1941,  
including the ships involved and the results of the battles.

The dataset used in this project is adapted for educational purposes and may differ from historical records to better  
support learning SQL concepts.

## Objectives
- Identify the `ship` and `result` of the "Pearl Harbor" battle from the `Outcomes` table of the **battleship database**.  
- Ensure the results are sorted by ship names in **ascending** order.  
- Note that the order of the columns is essential.

Take a look at the following database structure:

## Explanation of the database:  

The `**Classes**` table represents different categories of ships that participated in the World War II.  
    It stores information about each: **ship class**, including:
- `class`: the class name. It is the `primary key`.  
- `type`:type of ship represented as: battleship (`'bb'`) or battlecruiser (`'bc'`),  
- `country`: the country where the ship was built  
- `numGuns`: the number of main guns  
- `bore`: the gun caliber represented by the bore diameter in inches,  
- `displacement`: and the displacement (displacement) measured in weight tons.

The `**Ships**` table contains details about each ship, including:  
- `name`: the name of the ship. It is the `primary key`. 
- `class`: the class to which it belongs. It is the `foreign key` to category of ships defined in the Classes table.
- `launched`: and the year it was launched into the water.

The `**Battles**` table stores information about the various battles in which the ships participated during the World War II.  
    It includes:  
- `name`: the name of the battle. It is the `primary key`.
- `date`: the date on which the battle took place.

The `**Outcomes**` table provides data on the results of the ship's participation in each battle. It includes:  
- `name`: the name of the ship that took part in the battle  
- `batlle`: the name of the battle in which the ship participated  
- `result`: the result of the ship's involvement:
  - categorized as "sunk" if the ship was sunk during the battle,  
  - "damaged" if the ship was damaged during the battle,  
  - "OK" if the ship remained undamaged after the battle.

Table names are case-sensitive.

## Example

_Outcomes Table Example:_

| ship         | battle               | result  |
|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| Yamagumo     | Battle of Okinawa    | OK      |
| Nagato       | Pearl Harbor         | sunk    |
| USS Caroline | Battle of Leyte Gulf | damaged |
| Bismarck     | Pearl Harbor         | OK      |
| Ise          | Battle of Leyte Gulf | OK      |

The table above shows that the ships `Nagato` and `Bismarck` participated in the "Pearl Harbor" battle.  
The table output after filtering for entries where the battle is "Pearl Harbor" is as follows:

| ship     | result |
|----------|--------|
| Bismarck | OK     |
| Nagato   | sunk   |


_From the output above, it can be seen that the order of the columns is `ship`-> `result`_
